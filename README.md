# CV Text Improver

## Description
The CV Text Improver is a web application designed to help users enhance their curriculum vitae (CV) or resume text. It leverages Artificial Intelligence, specifically the `bigscience/bloom-560m` language model, to refine user-provided text, making it more professional and grammatically correct. The application also provides a heuristic-based scoring system to show the "before" and "after" quality of the text, considering factors like grammar, readability, sentiment, and the presence of relevant CV keywords.

## Features
* **AI-Powered Text Enhancement**: Utilizes a pre-trained language model to suggest improvements to CV text.
* **Heuristic Scoring**: Calculates and displays scores for the original and improved text based on:
    * Grammar (using `language_tool_python`)
    * Readability (using `textstat` for Flesch reading ease)
    * Sentiment Analysis (using a Hugging Face pipeline)
    * CV Keyword Density
* **Web Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface (built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for easy text input and viewing results.
* **Before & After Comparison**: Clearly shows the original text, the improved version, and their respective scores.

## Tech Stack
* **Backend**: Python, Flask
* **AI/Machine Learning**:
    * Hugging Face `transformers` library
    * `bigscience/bloom-560m` model
    * `PyTorch`
* **Text Analysis & Heuristics**:
    * `language_tool_python` for grammar checking
    * `textstat` for readability metrics
* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (served via Flask templates)
* **Key Python Libraries**: (A comprehensive list is in `requirements.txt`)
    * `Flask`
    * `torch`
    * `transformers`
    * `language_tool_python`
    * `textstat`

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository (or ensure you have all project files):**
    Make sure you have `app.py`, `AI.py`, `heuristics.py`, `requirements.txt`, and the `templates` folder (containing `index.html`) and `static` folder (containing `styles.css`) in your project directory.

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This will install all the necessary Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

4.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will start a local development server, typically accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
2.  You will see the CV Text Improver interface.
3.  Paste the section of your CV text you want to improve into the input textarea.
4.  Click the "Improve Text" (or similarly named) button.
5.  The application will process the text. You will then see:
    * The original heuristic score for your input text.
    * The AI-generated improved version of your text.
    * The new heuristic score for the improved text.

## How It Works

1.  **Frontend Interaction**: The user enters text into an HTML form and submits it.
2.  **Backend Processing (`app.py`)**:
    * The Flask application receives the text via a POST request to the `/improve` endpoint.
    * It calculates the initial heuristic score of the user's input text using the `heuristic_score` function from `heuristics.py`.
    * The input text is then passed to the `improve_cv_text` function in `AI.py`.
3.  **AI Text Improvement (`AI.py`)**:
    * A prompt is constructed to guide the `bigscience/bloom-560m` model.
    * The text is tokenized, processed by the model using specified parameters (like `max_length`, `num_beams`, `temperature`), and then decoded back into text.
4.  **Scoring Improved Text (`app.py`, `heuristics.py`)**:
    * The improved text generated by the AI is scored again using the `heuristic_score` function.
5.  **Returning Results (`app.py`)**:
    * The Flask backend returns a JSON response containing the improved text, the original score, and the new score to the frontend.
6.  **Displaying Results**: The JavaScript on the frontend updates the page to display the improved text and the scores.
